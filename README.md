# selfdriving_env_sim
This works attempts to build a complete top-down controller to solve a partial SD task for navigating a car in a simulated environment based on common practises in autonomous vehicles.

Utilizes:
    -CARLA simulator
    -some of the excellent methods proposed in Coursera Self-Driving Cars specialization.
    -some of the standard source code from CARLA demo.
    -uses only classic algorithms without AI technics.

Still required minimum (TODO):
    --Add complete ego state estimation model.
    --Add obstacle grid.
    --Optimizations required.
